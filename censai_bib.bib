        abstract = {Much of the recent research on solving iterative inference problems focuses on moving away from hand-chosen inference algorithms and towards learned inference. In the latter, the inference process is unrolled in time and interpreted as a recurrent neural network (RNN) which allows for joint learning of model and inference parameters with back-propagation through time. In this framework, the RNN architecture is directly derived from a hand-chosen inference algorithm, effectively limiting its capabilities. We propose a learning framework, called Recurrent Inference Machines (RIM), in which we turn algorithm construction the other way round: Given data and a task, train an RNN to learn an inference algorithm. Because RNNs are Turing complete [1, 2] they are capable to implement any inference algorithm. The framework allows for an abstraction which removes the need for domain knowledge. We demonstrate in several image restoration experiments that this abstraction is effective, allowing us to achieve state-of-the-art performance on image denoising and super-resolution tasks and superior across-task generalization.},

IllustrisTNG is a suite of large volume, cosmological, gravo-magnetohydrodynamical simulations run with the moving-mesh code Arepo . TNG includes a comprehensive model for galaxy formation physics, and each TNG simulation self-consistently solves for the coupled evolution of dark matter, cosmic gas, luminous stars, and supermassive black holes from early time to the present day,   $z=0$  z = 0    . Each of the flagship runs—TNG50, TNG100, and TNG300—are accompanied by halo/subhalo catalogs, merger trees, lower-resolution and dark-matter only counterparts, all available with 100 snapshots. We discuss scientific and numerical cautions and caveats relevant when using TNG. The data volume now directly accessible online is ∼750 TB, including 1200 full volume snapshots and ∼80,000 high time-resolution subbox snapshots. This will increase to ∼1.1 PB with the future release of TNG50. Data access and analysis examples are available in IDL, Python, and Matlab. We describe improvements and new functionality in the web-based API, including on-demand visualization and analysis of galaxies and halos, exploratory plotting of scaling relations and other relationships between galactic and halo properties, and a new JupyterLab interface. This provides an online, browser-based, near-native data analysis platform enabling user computation with local access to TNG data, alleviating the need to download large datasets.},

@article{Rau2013,
        abstract = {High-resolution dark-matter-only simulations provide a realistic and fully general means to study the theoretical predictions of cosmological structure formation models for gravitational lensing. Due to the finite number of particles, the density field only becomes smooth on scales beyond a few times the local mean interparticle separation. This introduces noise on the gravitational lensing properties such as the surface mass density, the deflection angles and the magnification. At some small-scale mass limit, the noise due to the discreteness of the N-body simulation becomes comparable to the effects of physical substructures. We present analytic expressions to quantify the Poisson noise and study its scaling with the particle number of the simulation and the Lagrangian smoothing size. We use the Phoenix set of simulations, currently the largest available dark matter simulations of clusters to study the effect of limited numerical resolution and the gravitational strong lensing effects of substructure. We quantify the smallest resolved substructure, in the sense that the effect of the substructure on any strong lensing property is significant compared to the noise, and we find that the result is roughly independent of the strong lensing property. A simple scaling relates the smallest resolved substructures in a simulation with the resolution of the N-body simulation {\textcopyright} 2013 The Authors.

This is the first paper in a series where we describe our strategy for addressing the various technical challenges in the production of weak lensing measurements from the COSMOS data. The COSMOS ACS catalog is constructed from 575 ACS/WFC tiles (1.64 deg^2) and contains a total 1.2x10^6 objects to a limiting magnitude of F814W=26.5. This catalog is made publicly available. The shapes of galaxies have been measured and corrected for the distortion induced by the time varying ACS Point Spread Function and for Charge Transfer Efficiency effects. Next, simulated images are used to derive the shear susceptibility factors that are necessary in order to transform shape measurements into unbiased shear estimators. Finally, for each galaxy, we derive a shape measurement error and utilize this quantity to extract the intrinsic shape noise of the galaxy sample. Interestingly, our results indicate that the intrinsic shape noise varies little with either size, magnitude or redshift. Representing a number density of 66 galaxies per arcmin^2, the final COSMOS weak lensing catalog contains 3.9x10^5 galaxies with accurate shape measurements. The properties of the COSMOS weak lensing catalog described throughout this paper will provide key input numbers for the preparation and design of next-generation wide field space missions.},

This measurement requires extremely precise estimation of very small galaxy shape distortions, in the presence of far larger intrinsic galaxy shapes and distortions due to the blurring kernel caused by the atmosphere, telescope optics, and instrumental effects. The GREAT3 challenge is posed to the astronomy, machine learning, and statistics communities, and includes tests of three specific effects that are of immediate relevance to upcoming weak lensing surveys, two of which have never been tested in a community challenge before. These effects include many novel aspects including realistically complex galaxy models based on high-resolution imaging from space; a spatially varying, physically motivated blurring kernel; and a combination of multiple different exposures. To facilitate entry by people new to the field, and for use as a diagnostic tool, the simulation software for the challenge is publicly available, though the exact parameters used for the challenge are blinded.

        abstract = {Deep learning allows for accelerated magnetic resonance image (MRI) reconstruction, thereby shortening measurement times. Rather than using sparsifying transforms, a prerequisite in Compressed Sensing (CS), suitable MRI prior distributions are learned from data. In clinical practice, both the underlying anatomy as well as image acquisition settings vary. For this reason, deep neural networks must be able to reapply what they learn across different measurement conditions. We propose to use Recurrent Inference Machines (RIM) as a framework for accelerated MRI reconstruction. RIMs solve inverse problems in an iterative and recurrent inference procedure by repeatedly reassessing the state of their reconstruction, and subsequently making incremental adjustments to it in accordance with the forward model of accelerated MRI. RIMs learn the inferential process of reconstructing a given signal, which, in combination with the use of internal states as part of their recurrent architecture, makes them less dependent on learning the features pertaining to the source of the signal itself. This gives RIMs a low tendency to overfit, and a high capacity to generalize to unseen types of data. We demonstrate this ability with respect to anatomy by reconstructing brain and knee scans, as well as other MRI acquisition settings, by reconstructing scans of different contrast and resolution, at different field strength, subjected to varying acceleration levels. We show that RIMs outperform CS not only with respect to quality metrics, but also according to a rating given by an experienced neuroradiologist in a double blinded experiment. Finally, we show with qualitative results that our model can be applied to prospectively under-sampled raw data, as acquired by pre-installed acquisition protocols.},

        abstract = {We present a machine learning method for the reconstruction of the undistorted images of background sources in strongly lensed systems. This method treats the source as a pixelated image and utilizes the Recurrent Inference Machine (RIM) to iteratively reconstruct the background source given a lens model. Our architecture learns to minimize the likelihood of the model parameters (source pixels) given the data using the physical forward model (ray tracing simulations) while implicitly learning the prior of the source structure from the training data. This results in better performance compared to linear inversion methods, where the prior information is limited to the 2-point covariance of the source pixels approximated with a Gaussian form, and often specified in a relatively arbitrary manner. We combine our source reconstruction network with a convolutional neural network that predicts the parameters of the mass distribution in the lensing galaxies directly from telescope images, allowing a fully automated reconstruction of the background source images and the foreground mass distribution.},

@article{Morningstar2018,
        abstract = {We use convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to estimate the parameters of strong gravitational lenses from interferometric observations. We explore multiple strategies, including training a feed-forward CNN on dirty images, and find that neural networks can simultaneously adapt to dirty images generated from vastly different uv-coverages. We find that the best results are obtained when the effects of the dirty beam are first removed from the images with a deconvolution performed with an RNN-based structure before estimating the parameters. For this purpose, we use the recurrent inference machine (RIM) introduced in Putzky \& Welling (2017). This provides a fast and automated alternative to the traditional CLEAN algorithm. We obtain the uncertainties of the estimated parameters using variational inference with Bernoulli distributions. We test the performance of the networks with a simulated test dataset as well as with five ALMA observations of strong lenses. For the observed ALMA data we compare our estimates with values obtained from a maximum-likelihood lens modeling method which operates in the visibility space and find consistent results. We show that we can estimate the lensing parameters with high accuracy using a combination of an RNN structure performing image deconvolution and a CNN performing lensing analysis, with uncertainties less than a factor of two higher than those achieved with maximum-likelihood methods. Including the deconvolution procedure performed by RIM, a single evaluation can be done in about a second on a single GPU, providing a more than six orders of magnitude increase in analysis speed while using about eight orders of magnitude less computational resources compared to maximum-likelihood lens modeling in the uv-plane. We conclude that this is a promising method for the analysis of mm and cm interferometric data from current facilities (e.g., ALMA, JVLA) and future large interferometric observatories (e.g., SKA), where an analysis in the uv-plane could be difficult or unfeasible.},

@article{Aubert2007,
        abstract = {We present a numerical technique to compute the gravitational lensing induced by simulated haloes. It relies on a 2D-Tree domain decomposition in the lens plane combined with a description of N-body particles as extended clouds with a non-singular density. This technique is made fully adaptive by the use of a density-dependent smoothing which allows one to probe the lensing properties of haloes from the densest regions in the centre or in substructures to the low-density regions in the outskirts. 'Smooth Particle Lensing' (SPL) has some promising features. First, the deflection potential, the deflection angles, the convergence and the shear are direct and separate end-products of the SPL calculation and can be computed at an arbitrary distribution of points on the lens plane. Secondly, this flexibility avoids the use of interpolation or a finite differentiation procedure on a grid, does not require padding the region with zeros and focuses the computing power on relevant regions. The SPL algorithm is tested by populating isothermal spheres and ellipsoids with particles and then comparing the lensing calculations to the classical fast Fourier transform based technique and analytic solutions. We assess issues related to the resolution of the lensing code and the limitations set by the simulations themselves. We conclude by discussing how SPL can be used to predict the impact of substructures on strong lensing and how it can be generalized to weak-lensing and cosmic shear simulations. {\textcopyright} 2007 RAS.},

abstract = {We trained a large, deep convolutional neural network to classify the 1.2 million high-resolution images in the ImageNet LSVRC-2010 contest into the 1000 different classes. On the test data, we achieved top-1 and top-5 error rates of 37.5% and 17.0% which is considerably better than the previous state-of-the-art. The neural network, which has 60 million parameters and 650,000 neurons, consists of five convolutional layers, some of which are followed by max-pooling layers, and three fully-connected layers with a final 1000-way softmax. To make training faster, we used non-saturating neurons and a very efficient GPU implementation of the convolution operation. To reduce overriding in the fully-connected layers we employed a recently-developed regularization method called "dropout" that proved to be very effective. We also entered a variant of this model in the ILSVRC-2012 competition and achieved a winning top-5 test error rate of 15.3%, compared to 26.2% achieved by the second-best entry.},

        abstract = {Theoretical results suggest that in order to learn the kind of complicated functions that can represent high-level abstractions (e.g., in vision, language, and other AI-level tasks), one may need deep architectures. Deep architectures are composed of multiple levels of non-linear operations, such as in neural nets with many hidden layers or in complicated propositional formulae re-using many sub-formulae. Searching the parameter space of deep architectures is a difficult task, but learning algorithms such as those for Deep Belief Networks have recently been proposed to tackle this problem with notable success, beating the state-of-the-art in certain areas. This monograph discusses the motivations and principles regarding learning algorithms for deep architectures, in particular those exploiting as building blocks unsupervised learning of single-layer models such as Restricted Boltzmann Machines, used to construct deeper models such as Deep Belief Networks.},

        abstract = {Connectionist networks in which information is stored in weights on connections among simple processing units have attracted considerable interest in cognitive science. Much of the interest centers around two characteristics of these networks. First, the weights on connections between units need not be prewired by the model builder but rather may be established through training in which items to be learned are presented repeatedly to the network and the connection weights are adjusted in small increments according to a learning algorithm. Second, the networks may represent information in a distributed fashion. This chapter discusses the catastrophic interference in connectionist networks. Distributed representations established through the application of learning algorithms have several properties that are claimed to be desirable from the standpoint of modeling human cognition. These properties include content-addressable memory and so-called automatic generalization in which a network trained on a set of items responds correctly to other untrained items within the same domain. New learning may interfere catastrophically with old learning when networks are trained sequentially. The analysis of the causes of interference implies that at least some interference will occur whenever new learning may alter weights involved in representing old learning, and the simulation results demonstrate only that interference is catastrophic in some specific networks. {\textcopyright} 1989 Academic Press Inc.},

We use the forward reconstruction method implemented in the lens-fitting code lensed to investigate in great detail the properties of the lens and background source. We model the lens with different mass distributions, focusing in particular on the determination of the slope of the dark-matter component. The inherent degeneracy between the lens slope and the source size can be broken when we can isolate separate components of each lensed image, as in this case. For an elliptical power-law model, κ(r) ∼ r−t, the results favour a flatter-than-isothermal slope with a maximum-likelihood value of t = 0.08. Instead, when we consider the contribution of the baryonic matter separately, the maximum-likelihood value of the slope of the dark-matter component is t = 0.31 or t = 0.44, depending on the assumed initial mass function. We discuss the origin of this result by analysing in detail how the images and the sources change when the slope t changes. We also demonstrate that these slope values at the Einstein radius are not inconsistent with the recent forecast from the theory of structure formation in the ΛCDM model.}",

		  principles of probability theory. Starting from the basics
		  of probability, the authors develop the theory of
		  statistical inference using techniques, definitions, and
		  concepts that are statistical and are natural extensions
		  and consequences of previous concepts. Intended for
		  first-year graduate students, this book can be used for
		  students majoring in statistics who have a solid
		  mathematics background. It can also be used in a way that
		  stresses the more practical uses of statistical theory,
		  being more concerned with understanding basic statistical
		  concepts and deriving reasonable statistical procedures for
		  a variety of situations, and less concerned with formal
		  optimality investigations.}},
